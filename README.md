# Lecture: Capital Letters (Letras Capital)

Typeface design is endlessly fascinating for Dave Crossland because it combines 
visual culture, 
language, 
technology, 
capitalism, 
history – 
and despite being rather obscure as a design practice, is completely ubiquitous. 
Dave has been obsessed with a mission to liberate typography for over 15 years, 
and has commissioned thousands of libre fonts from hundreds of designers for dozens of writing systems. 

He presented a perspective on libre fonts inspired by the ideas of Marshall McLuhan, improvised using the following links:

# Workshop: Introduction to Typeface Design (Introducción al diseño de tipos de letra)

Design your own fonts with libre software (FontForge). 
Bring loose paper, a pencil (must be soft, B3+), and your laptop. 
You will start by learning the secrets of fast and easy letter sketching, 
and leave with a clear idea of how to create your very own font, 
that you can install in your computer and share with your friends. 
You will even learn how to earn money with font design skills!

It is required to bring a personal laptop. 
The workshop is limited to 30 persons.
It will be on Tuesday morning, a 4 hour block with a break in the middle, 9am to 1pm.
